Absolutely ✅ — here’s an **updated PRD** for your polyglot monorepo setup with all the enhancements you’ve discussed: **change-aware builds, dependency caching, pre-baked Docker images, Gradle orchestration, and AWS CodeBuild integration**.

# PRD: Polyglot Monorepo CI/CD & Build Optimization

## 1. **Overview**

This project manages a **polyglot monorepo** containing both **Node.js** and **Java** modules. The goal is to provide:

* **Change-aware builds**: Only rebuild modules that changed.
* **Unified commands**: Developers and CI/CD share `make` targets (`build`, `run`, `stop`, `deploy`, `version`, `release`).
* **Versioning & release management**: Managed via **Changesets** for Node and synced with Maven for Java.
* **Optimized CI/CD builds**: Using **custom Docker images**, dependency inspection, and Gradle remote caching.
* **AWS CodeBuild integration**: Reliable, reproducible, and fast builds with minimal network dependency.

---

## 2. **Goals**

1. Provide a **consistent developer experience** across Node and Java modules.
2. Ensure **incremental builds** (only modules that changed are rebuilt).
3. Maintain **deterministic and reproducible CI/CD builds**.
4. Optimize build performance using:

   * Pre-baked Docker images with local dependency repositories.
   * Remote Gradle cache for Java builds.
   * Node pnpm store caching.
5. Maintain a **single orchestration layer** via Make and Gradle.

---

## 3. **Non-Goals**

* Replacing Maven with Gradle for Java development.
* Replacing pnpm with Yarn/NPM.
* Introducing Nx or Turborepo unless specific DX enhancements are required.

---

## 4. **Requirements**

### 4.1 Module-level (Developer Workflows)

* **Node Modules**

  * Managed with `pnpm`.
  * Scripts: `build`, `start`, `stop`.
  * Changesets integrated for versioning.

* **Java Modules**

  * Managed with Maven.
  * Scripts: `clean install`, `spring-boot:run`, `test`.
  * Versions synced from Changesets when needed.

---

### 4.2 Root-level Orchestration

* Root `Makefile` provides consistent commands:

  * `make build` → builds only changed modules.
  * `make run` → runs only changed modules.
  * `make stop` → stops all running modules.
  * `make deploy` → deploys services.
  * `make version` → bumps versions (Node via Changesets, Java via Maven).
  * `make release` → publishes Node packages and deploys Java artifacts.

---

### 4.3 Change-Aware Builds

* **TypeScript CLI (`detectChanges.ts`)**

  * Uses `git diff` to detect changed modules.
  * Outputs `changes.json` describing affected Node and Java modules.
  * Optional: Includes **dependency graph awareness** (rebuild dependents of shared modules).

* **Makefile**

  * Reads `changes.json` and executes commands **only for changed modules**.

---

### 4.4 Versioning & Release Management

* **Node**: Uses `@changesets/cli` for version bumping, changelog generation, and publishing.
* **Java**:

  * Version bumps synchronized via `mvn versions:set` based on Changeset.
* Root-level commands wrap both ecosystems for CI/CD:

```makefile
version:
	pnpm changeset version
	# sync Java versions
	for mod in $(jq -r '.javaModules[]' scripts/changes.json); do \
		mvn -f modules/$$mod/pom.xml versions:set -DnewVersion=$(jq -r '.packages["$$mod"].version' package.json); \
	done
```

---

### 4.5 Custom Docker Images

* **Purpose**: Speed up CI/CD builds by pre-baking dependencies.
* **Features**:

  * Pre-installed: Node.js, pnpm, Java JDK, Maven, Gradle.
  * Pre-populated dependency caches:

    * Maven `~/.m2/repository`
    * pnpm store `~/.pnpm-store`
  * Multi-stage build: final image contains only artifacts (JARs, JS bundles).
* **Triggering image rebuilds**:

  * Inspect dependency files (`pom.xml`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
  * If they changed → rebuild Docker image.
  * Optional hash comparison for exact detection:

    ```bash
    DEP_HASH=$(git hash-object pom.xml package.json pnpm-lock.yaml)
    ```
* **Integration with CodeBuild**:

  * Use the image as the base build environment.
  * Reduces cold-start and network overhead.

---

### 4.6 CI/CD Integration (AWS CodeBuild)

* **Gradle orchestrates all steps**:

  ```groovy
  task buildAll(type: Exec) { commandLine "make", "build" }
  task runAll(type: Exec) { commandLine "make", "run" }
  task versionAll(type: Exec) { commandLine "make", "version" }
  task releaseAll(type: Exec) { commandLine "make", "release" }
  build.dependsOn buildAll
  ```
* **Pipeline Steps**:

  1. Detect changes: `detectChanges.ts` → `changes.json`.
  2. Conditionally build Docker image if dependencies changed.
  3. `./gradlew buildAll` → builds only changed modules.
  4. `./gradlew versionAll` → bumps versions.
  5. `./gradlew releaseAll` → publishes/deploys artifacts.
* **Caching**:

  * Gradle remote cache (S3) for Java tasks.
  * pnpm store cached via CodeBuild layer or ECR image.

---

### 4.7 Optional Enhancements

* Dependency graph awareness for rebuilds of dependent modules.
* Scheduled rebuilds of Docker image to refresh dependency cache.
* Multi-stage Docker images for deployment.
* Remote caching for Node tasks if needed in future (Turborepo optional).

---

## 5. **Acceptance Criteria**

* ✅ Local developers can run `make build/run/stop/deploy` consistently.
* ✅ Only changed modules are rebuilt.
* ✅ Versions are bumped consistently via Changesets + Maven sync.
* ✅ Docker image caching speeds up builds; rebuilt only when dependencies change.
* ✅ CI/CD pipelines in AWS CodeBuild use Gradle orchestration and leverage remote caching.
* ✅ Node and Java modules produce deployable artifacts.

---

## 6. **Directory / Artifact Considerations**

* `/modules` → Node and Java projects.
* `/scripts/detectChanges.ts` → change detection script.
* `/Makefile` → developer and CI commands.
* `/build.gradle` → Gradle orchestration.
* `/docker/` → Dockerfiles for pre-baked images.
* `/scripts/changes.json` → output from `detectChanges.ts`.
* `.changeset/` → Changesets versioning info.

---

This PRD now captures **all enhancements discussed**:

* Change-aware builds
* Versioning across Node + Java
* Pre-baked Docker images with dependency caches
* Conditional image rebuild based on dependency files
* Gradle orchestration
* AWS CodeBuild integration

If you want, I can next **draw a visual workflow diagram** showing **Docker build, change detection, Gradle orchestration, Makefile execution, and CodeBuild steps** — that usually makes it easier to share with stakeholders.

Do you want me to do that?
